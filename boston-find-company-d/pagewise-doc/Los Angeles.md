#### Los Angeles to San Diego

\~120 miles

A biotechnology company in Culver City planned a two-day offsite strategy session for 80 staff members at the Loews Coronado Bay Resort in San Diego. Rather than reimburse mileage for dozens of vehicles or risk employees getting stuck in I-5 traffic, the HR team booked two full-size charter buses for the roundtrip. Each charter bus in Los Angeles was scheduled to pick up at the company’s main office at 7:00 a.m. sharp, with a planned arrival at the resort by 10:30 a.m. to allow for a breakfast break at the hotel before meetings began. The driver followed the I-405 south to the I-5 corridor, a direct route with dedicated bus lanes through [Orange](https://shuttlebus.net/orange-bus-rental/) County and two rest stop options in [Oceanside](https://shuttlebus.net/oceanside-bus-rental/) and [Carlsbad](https://shuttlebus.net/carlsbad-bus-rental/) for coffee and restroom breaks.

To avoid downtown San Diego congestion, the charter buses exited the I-5 at the Silver Strand Boulevard cutoff, which leads directly onto Coronado Island via the north causeway. This route ensures the staff arrived together, on time, and without the hassle of finding parking at a busy beach resort. The company paid $2,800 per charter bus, totaling $5,600 for the roundtrip, which included driver gratuity and tolls. This cost-effective solution not only kept the team unified but also provided undercarriage storage for luggage and presentation materials.

Estimated travel time: 3–3.5 hours depending on traffic.

#### Los Angeles to Las Vegas Charter Bus

\~ 270 miles

In May 2023, a corporate client from Downtown Los Angeles contacted Shuttlebus.net to arrange transportation for a team-building weekend in Las Vegas. The group consisted of 40 employees who needed to be picked up from their office near 7th Street and Figueroa Street in Downtown LA and transported to the Bellagio Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas. The client requested a charter bus rental that would depart Los Angeles at 8:00 AM on Friday and return from Las Vegas at 3:00 PM on Sunday. The route included a stop in Barstow for lunch and a brief rest break at the Nevada state line. The total distance for the round trip was approximately 540 miles. The client chose a full-size charter bus with WiFi, power outlets, and reclining seats to ensure a comfortable ride for their employees. The estimated travel time from Los Angeles to Las Vegas was 4.5 to 5 hours each way, depending on traffic conditions on I-15. The total cost for the three-day charter bus rental was $5,400, which included driver gratuity, fuel, and tolls. The client was satisfied with the service and has since booked additional trips with Shuttlebus.net for other corporate events.

Estimated Travel Time: \~4.5 to 5 hours

#### Los Angeles to Las Vegas Charter Bus

\~270 miles

One of the most popular requests we get is for a charter bus from Los Angeles to Las Vegas. This route is perfect for corporate retreats, family reunions, or [bachelor/bachelorette parties](https://shuttlebus.net/wedding-bus-rental/) looking for a fun and convenient way to travel to Sin City. In June 2023, a tech company based in Downtown Los Angeles booked a 56-passenger charter bus for their annual team-building trip to Las Vegas. The group was picked up at their office on Wilshire Blvd at 8:00 AM and arrived at their hotel on the Las Vegas Strip around 1:30 PM, with a 30-minute stop for lunch in Baker, CA. The charter bus provided plenty of space for luggage, comfortable seating, and onboard WiFi for employees who needed to catch up on work during the drive.

The company opted for a three-day package, which included round-trip transportation and a driver hotel room for two nights. The total cost for the charter bus rental was $6,950, which included all taxes, tolls, and driver gratuity. This breaks down to about $125 per person for round-trip transportation, making it an affordable and efficient option for large groups traveling from Los Angeles to Las Vegas. The company was able to avoid the hassle of coordinating multiple carpool groups, paying for individual parking at the hotel, and ensuring everyone arrived on time.

Approximate travel time: 4–5 hours

#### Carson to Los Angeles Convention Center

\~15 miles

When a local university's cheerleading squad needed to get to the Los Angeles Convention Center for a multi-day competition, their athletic department called Shuttlebus.net to arrange [group transportation](https://shuttlebus.net/group-transportation-services/). Their university is located in [Carson](https://shuttlebus.net/carson-bus-rental/), just south of downtown Los Angeles, so this trip across the city is a common route for us\! The squad was traveling with 25 athletes, four coaches, and all their uniforms, equipment, and coolers for the day. Having used charter buses before, the university knew a full-size bus would give them plenty of space for everyone to ride together and keep all their gear safe under the bus.

The group was picked up at the university’s main athletic parking lot at 6:00 a.m. sharp. Their driver took the 110 Freeway north straight into downtown, getting them to the convention center in under an hour—even with a quick stop at a Starbucks drive-thru near [USC](https://www.usc.edu/) for coffee along the way. The cheerleaders were dropped off right at the South Hall entrance, so they didn’t have to drag their bags across Figueroa Street or pay for multiple rideshares. The bus then parked at a designated charter bus parking area nearby until it was time to pick them up at 6:00 p.m. after the competition ended.

For this local charter bus rental in Los Angeles, the university paid $1,500 for a full-day charter bus rental. This included the driver’s tip and the cost of parking the bus downtown while the competition was going on. The coach said the best part was not having to worry about parking or getting stuck in traffic during rush hour on the way home—everyone just got on the bus and relaxed after a long day.

Estimated Travel Time: \~1 hour

A film production company based in Hollywood needed to shuttle 40 cast and crew members to multiple filming locations in Downtown Los Angeles for a week-long shoot. The production office was located near Hollywood Blvd and Vine St, and the primary filming location was at a warehouse in the Arts District (777 S [Alameda](https://shuttlebus.net/alameda-bus-rental/) St, Los Angeles, CA 90021).

#### Long Beach to Los Angeles

\~25 Miles

In October, the Port of Long Beach held a logistics summit for 140 supply chain professionals at the California Market Center in Downtown Los Angeles. The event started at 9:00 AM, with attendees arriving from multiple shipping terminals along the Long Beach waterfront. Because parking is limited and expensive in Downtown LA, the port authority booked an employee shuttle bus service to run a continuous loop between the CMC and Long Beach for the two-day event. They needed a flexible schedule and a driver who could easily navigate traffic on the I-710 and I-110 freeways during rush hour.

To accommodate the entire group, the reservation specialist recommended three 56-passenger shuttle buses for a full day. This would ensure there would be enough room for each employee and space for personal belongings. At the end of the event, the driver would transport the group to their home terminals or designated location.

The price of three 56-passenger shuttle buses for a full day was $6,960.

#### Santa Monica to Dodger Stadium

\~20 miles

A Santa Monica-based tech company wanted to treat their employees to a night out at Dodger Stadium for a Dodgers game. The company had 75 employees attending and wanted to make sure everyone could relax and enjoy the game without worrying about driving or parking in downtown LA. They decided to book a private shuttle bus to take everyone from their office in Santa Monica to Dodger Stadium and back. The Shuttlebus.net team picked up the group at their office on Colorado Avenue around 5:00 PM, allowing plenty of time to get through rush hour traffic on the I-10 and I-110 freeways and arrive at the stadium before the 7:10 PM first pitch. The driver dropped the group off at the designated charter bus lot at Dodger Stadium, where the bus waited during the game to take everyone back to Santa Monica after the final out. The company booked a 56-passenger shuttle bus with a second smaller 25-passenger shuttle bus to accommodate their group and paid $2,800 for the full day, which included the driver's tip and a parking fee at the stadium.

The school paid $2,400 total for the two buses, which included driver gratuity, tolls, and parking fees. The trip was completed on schedule with zero delays or incidents.

#### Los Angeles to Disneyland

\~28 miles

In May 2023, a high school in Downtown Los Angeles organized a senior class trip to Disneyland in Anaheim. The school needed affordable, reliable transportation for 140 students and 10 chaperones, so they contacted Shuttlebus.net for a school bus rental. The trip required buses to pick up students at 7:00 AM from the school's campus near MacArthur Park and drop them off at Disneyland's bus loading zone on Harbor Boulevard. The group planned to spend the entire day at the park and return to Los Angeles after the park closed at 9:00 PM. Because Disneyland has strict drop-off and pick-up procedures for charter vehicles, the drivers coordinated with park staff to ensure smooth arrivals and departures. The school also requested air-conditioned buses due to the warm weather forecast.

Shuttlebus.net provided three 48-passenger, air-conditioned school buses, each equipped with comfortable seating and storage space for backpacks and coolers. The buses departed Los Angeles promptly at 7:00 AM, arriving at Disneyland by 8:15 AM, and remained on standby in Anaheim until the return trip at 9:30 PM. The total cost for the school bus rental, including driver gratuity and standby time, was $4,800.

Estimated Travel Time: \~1 hour 15 minutes

#### Long Beach to Hollywood

\~30 miles

A local Long Beach youth theater group needed reliable, affordable transportation for a day trip to the Pantages Theatre in Hollywood for a special matinee performance. With 60 students and 8 chaperones, they needed a solution that would keep everyone together, on time, and within budget. The group leader contacted Shuttlebus.net, and we recommended two 44-passenger school buses. The buses picked up the group at 8:00 AM from the Long Beach Civic Center, allowing plenty of time for the 30-mile drive up I-710 and US-101 into Hollywood. The performance was at 10:30 AM, and the buses waited nearby until the show ended at 1:00 PM. The return trip included a quick stop for lunch at a nearby park before heading back to Long Beach. The entire trip took about 6 hours round-trip, and the cost was $2,400 for both buses, including driver gratuity and parking fees in Hollywood.

Approximate travel time: 1 hour each way

#### Downtown LA to Dodger Stadium

\~3 Miles

A local youth baseball league in Los Angeles needed safe, reliable transportation to take 100 players, coaches, and chaperones from their practice facility in Downtown LA to Dodger Stadium for a special event. The league has used Shuttlebus.net before for school bus transportation in Los Angeles, so they called again to get a quote for this important trip. The pickup location was at a community center near 7th and Figueroa in Downtown LA, and the drop-off location was at the designated bus parking area at Dodger Stadium, located at 1000 Vin Scully Ave, Los Angeles, CA 90012\. The distance between the two locations is approximately 3 miles, but with traffic and road closures around the stadium, the trip can take anywhere from 15 to 30 minutes each way.

To accommodate the group, Shuttlebus.net provided two school buses, each with a capacity of 50 passengers. The buses were scheduled to pick up the group at 4:00 PM, transport them to Dodger Stadium, and then return them to the original pickup location at 10:00 PM after the event. The total cost for the two school bus rentals was $2,400, which included the driver’s time, fuel, and all necessary permits for operating in the city of Los Angeles. The league was able to split the cost among the participants, making it an affordable option for everyone involved.

Approximate travel time: 15-30 minutes each way, depending on traffic and road closures around Dodger Stadium.

## **FAQs**

#### West Hollywood to Malibu

\~27 miles

One of our favorite wedding shuttle routes is from West Hollywood to Malibu, where couples can enjoy a scenic coastal celebration without worrying about transportation logistics. Recently, we provided a wedding shuttle service for a couple who hosted their ceremony at a private estate in West Hollywood and their reception at Calamigos Ranch in Malibu. The distance between the two locations is approximately 27 miles, and the drive along the Pacific Coast Highway offers stunning ocean views that set the perfect tone for a romantic event.

The couple booked a 56-passenger charter bus to accommodate their guests, ensuring everyone arrived together and on time. The bus was equipped with reclining seats, air conditioning, and a sound system, allowing guests to relax and enjoy the ride. The driver made two quick stops along the way for guests to grab snacks and use the restroom, and the entire trip took about 1 hour and 15 minutes due to moderate traffic.

The cost for this full-day wedding shuttle service was $2,400, which included the driver's tip and a small parking fee at the reception venue. By choosing Shuttlebus.net, the couple ensured their guests had a safe and comfortable ride, and they didn't have to worry about anyone getting lost or arriving late.

#### Santa Monica to Calamigos Ranch

\~35 Miles

When Jennifer and Mark planned their Malibu wedding at Calamigos Ranch, they knew transportation would be a challenge. Their guest list included 90 people staying at hotels in Santa Monica and Venice Beach, and the venue’s winding canyon roads made carpooling or rideshares impractical. To keep everyone safe and on schedule, they decided to book a charter bus rental in Los Angeles. The couple contacted Shuttlebus.net and requested two minibus shuttles to run a continuous loop from the hotels to the venue.

On the day of the wedding, the first bus picked up guests at the Fairmont [Miramar](https://shuttlebus.net/miramar-bus-rental/) Hotel in Santa Monica at 1:30 PM, followed by stops at the Hotel Erwin in Venice Beach and the Viceroy Santa Monica. The 35-mile drive along the Pacific Coast Highway took about 75 minutes due to weekend traffic, but guests arrived relaxed and on time for the 3:00 PM ceremony. After the reception ended at 10:00 PM, the shuttles made two return trips to ensure everyone got back safely. The total cost for the two minibuses, including the driver’s gratuity and fuel surcharge, was $2,800. This price included unlimited mileage for the day and a dedicated driver for each bus.

Approximate travel time: 75 minutes

#### Santa Monica to Malibu

\~20 Miles

A couple is planning a wedding at Calamigos Ranch in Malibu and needs to make sure their 100 guests can get from Santa Monica to the venue safely and on time. Since the venue is deep in the Malibu hills and parking is limited, they decide to book a charter bus to shuttle guests from a central pickup location in Santa Monica to the ranch. The trip is about 20 miles each way and takes about 45 minutes to an hour depending on traffic on the PCH. The couple books two 56-passenger charter buses to run a loop from Santa Monica to Malibu and back at the end of the night. The buses will pick up guests at 2:00 PM for a 4:00 PM ceremony and return them to Santa Monica at 11:00 PM after the reception ends. The total cost for the two buses for the day is $3,000.

Estimated Travel Time: \~45 minutes to 1 hour

#### Santa Monica to Malibu

\~20 miles

A couple is hosting their wedding at the Malibu Rocky Oaks Estate Vineyards and wants to provide a luxury transportation experience for their 100 guests. The venue is located at 340 Kanan Rd, Malibu, CA 90265, which is about a 45-minute drive from Santa Monica. The couple is concerned about the winding roads leading up to the venue and wants to ensure their guests arrive safely and on time. They also want to provide a shuttle service at the end of the night to take guests back to their hotels in Santa Monica and West Hollywood.

Their reservation specialist recommends a 56-passenger charter bus for the main guest list and a sprinter van for the bridal party. The charter bus will pick up guests at the Fairmont Miramar Hotel & Bungalows in Santa Monica at 3:00 PM and drop them off at the venue by 4:00 PM. The sprinter van will pick up the bridal party at the same location at 2:00 PM. At the end of the night, the charter bus will make two trips back to Santa Monica, with the first departing at 10:00 PM and the second at 11:00 PM.

## **FAQs**

### I've never rented a wedding transportation in Los Angeles, what do I need to know?

When renting wedding transportation in Los Angeles, the most important thing to know is that you need to book early. LA traffic is unpredictable, parking is often limited at popular venues, and the best vehicles get reserved quickly-especially during peak wedding season from April to October. You should also know that most venues in the city don't have enough parking for all your guests, so a shuttle is often required. The good news is that when you book with Shuttlebus.net, we handle all the logistics for you. We've been providing wedding transportation in Los Angeles since 2011, so we know how to navigate the 405, the 101, and the 110, and we know how to get your guests to your venue on time. When you book with us, you will get a dedicated driver and a 24/7 support team.

### How can I make sure my wedding guests don't get stuck in LA traffic?

Booking a private wedding shuttle with Shuttlebus.net is the best way to keep everyone on schedule. We build custom routes that avoid bottlenecks like the 405/101 interchange, Sepulveda Pass, and the 110/105 split. Your driver knows how to navigate side streets around downtown congestion and will use real-time GPS to adjust for accidents or construction delays. This means your guests arrive together and on time, even if they're coming from different parts of the city.

### What's the best way to handle guest transportation for a Malibu or beach wedding?

The best way to handle guest transportation for a Malibu or beach wedding is to use a private shuttle service. Parking is extremely limited and expensive at venues like Malibu West Beach Club or Saddlerock Ranch, and PCH traffic can cause major delays. We recommend setting a central pickup location in LA or the Valley and running shuttles that drop guests directly at the venue. This ensures everyone arrives together and on time, without the stress of navigating or paying for parking.

### How do I get guests to and from a downtown LA wedding venue without them getting lost?

The easiest way to get guests to and from a downtown LA wedding venue is to use a private shuttle service. Downtown has complicated one-way streets and expensive parking garages, which can be confusing for out-of-town visitors. We can set pickup points at hotels or Union Station and run shuttles directly to your venue on Broadway or Figueroa. This keeps everyone together and on schedule, especially if your reception runs late or you have multiple events in different locations.
