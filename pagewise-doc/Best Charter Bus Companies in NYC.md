### **Mike S (4.5)**

I can’t thank Shuttlebus.net enough for making our wedding day run so smoothly. We had guests coming from all over LA, and they made sure everyone got to the ceremony at Elysian Park and then to the reception in Silver Lake on time. The driver was so friendly, the bus was spotless, and it took so much stress off our family. 100% recommend\!

### **Nathan K (5)**

I booked Shuttlebus.net to shuttle our guests from the Kimpton Everly Hotel in Hollywood to our wedding at the Houdini Estate in Laurel Canyon, and it was the best decision I made\! The driver was on time, the bus was clean and comfortable, and our guests loved not having to deal with parking or Ubers in the hills.

### **Tom P (4.5)**

We used Shuttlebus.net for our wedding transportation from downtown LA to the South Park Center and everything went perfectly.

The booking process was simple and the price was reasonable for what we needed. I would definitely recommend it.

I highly recommend it\!
